- sort alphabetically (-sort a)
- sort by count (-sort c)
- print lines that words occur on (-printlines)
- specify "noise" words to skip (-skip "...")
- specify minimum word length (-minlength)
- group by identicality of first 'n' letters (-group <n>)

@todo: group by identicality
    - get all words in a string array
    - create an arbitrary number of groups (create an array of an array of strings)
    - group them by comparing each word to the previous
    - for each group, print out the strings, separate groups by a new line.
